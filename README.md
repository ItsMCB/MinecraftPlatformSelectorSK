# Minecraft Platform Selector SK
This skript lets players choose what Minecraft platform they are on so that you can tailor their experience through Luck Perm groups.

Designed to be used in a server hub. Created for the South Hollow and Vexel Games Minecraft server.

## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge on how to install and edit skripts
* Basic knowledge of how to use Luck Perms

## Dependencies
* Skript - Tested on 2.5-beta1, but should work on some older versions.
* SkQuery - Test on version 4.1.2, but should work on some older versions.
